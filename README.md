This is a small project following WebDevCody's pair programming tool tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpyiSEO7a_Y&t=2096s
Wanted to learn a bit more of different ORM's, some authentication setup through a full-stack application and found this
to be the perfect video to lead me through one.

I'm hoping to apply some of what I've learned as a full-stack developer to put a small twist on his approach to problems that better
match my abilities as a programmer.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
